Given a set of characters represented by a String, return a list containing all subsets of the characters.

# Assumptions

There are no duplicate characters in the original set.


# Examples

Set = "abc", all the subsets are [“”, “a”, “ab”, “abc”, “ac”, “b”, “bc”, “c”]
Set = "", all the subsets are [""]
Set = null, all the subsets are []
