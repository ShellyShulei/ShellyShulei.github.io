## No.1 All SubSets
Given a set of characters represented by a String, return a list containing all subsets of the characters.

### Assumptions
There are no duplicate characters in the original set.

### Examples
Set = "abc", all the subsets are [“”, “a”, “ab”, “abc”, “ac”, “b”, “bc”, “c”]
Set = "", all the subsets are [""]
Set = null, all the subsets are []

## No.2 All Valid Permutations Of Parentheses I
Given N pairs of parentheses “()”, return a list with all the valid permutations.

### Assumptions
N > 0

### Examples
N = 1, all valid permutations are ["()"]
N = 3, all valid permutations are ["((()))", "(()())", "(())()", "()(())", "()()()"]

## No.3 Combinations Of Coins
Given a number of different denominations of coins (e.g., 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 25 cents), get all the possible ways to pay a target number of cents.

### Assumptions
coins - an array of positive integers representing the different denominations of coins, there are no duplicate numbers and the numbers are sorted by descending order, eg. {25, 10, 5, 2, 1}
target - a non-negative integer representing the target number of cents, eg. 99

### Examples
coins = {2, 1}, target = 4, the return should be

[

  [0, 4],   (4 cents can be conducted by 0 * 2 cents + 4 * 1 cents)

  [1, 2],   (4 cents can be conducted by 1 * 2 cents + 2 * 1 cents)

  [2, 0]    (4 cents can be conducted by 2 * 2 cents + 0 * 1 cents)

]

## No.4 All Permutations I
Given a string with no duplicate characters, return a list with all permutations of the characters.

### Assumptions
Assume that input string is not null.

### Examples
Set = “abc”, all permutations are [“abc”, “acb”, “bac”, “bca”, “cab”, “cba”]

Set = "", all permutations are [""]
